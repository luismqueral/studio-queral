**Was asked this recently in Slack:**
>One quick question, are designers somehow uploading figma designs to cursor or are you prompting your way into designs? (maybe that’s not a quick question…)

**And here was my response:**
>Right now designers aren't really using cursor (or GenAI) at all, so that's where we've been starting
>
>We're in the early stages of getting folks familiar with generative tooling and experimenting with where it might be useful, since it's not clear yet…but to answer your question, there are some Figma --> Cursor workflows, but the small percentage of Cursor-using designers have bypassed Figma entirely and are going straight to code
>
>I'll also say that interface-making is one of several pieces of "Generative Design" workflows, managing research and synthesizing datasets from research initiatives is by far the most immediate, practical use case at the moment for design work.

Leaving this here to think about more later, since I've been getting questions like this kind of a lot and want to have an answer I feel confident in.

I don't necessarily disagree with what I wrote, but I want to sit with this one a bit and see how it ages.
