Here's a small artifact used in the making of this log (that turned into the entire site).

I don't like working in all of these typescript files and would rather work with old-school HTML to essentially design this blog (and site frankly):

```
Okay, new branch `html-templates`. I am looking for you to create a directory of html-mocks of the studio log blog using the same tachyons styling.

It's easier for me to edit these and then have you look at them and update the styling in the JS, does that make sense?

Please first list out the templates, and you can use the existing content for now (this may or may not scale well).
```

LLM's seem really good at translating all of this to the adjacent React codebase, so that's nice.
