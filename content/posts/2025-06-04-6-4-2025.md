I don't have time to play with this now, but an Ableton MCP is really interesting. I wonder how well it performs, I'll add it to my list of things that I'll hope to experiment in the near future.

For future reference, I'd like to recreate a workflow that I had in my head back in 2012ish, when I was first coming up with the concept of [Jump City Records](https://github.com/luismqueral/jumpcityrecords). I originally wanted to script Ableton Live, but I ended up, after much research, that click-and-point scripting wasn't really feasible or reliable.

So I guess in this universe maybe, just maybe, I could use an MCP to control/script Live to generate audio in the way I originally wanted.

This is how it ended up in the final python script, which honestly works great still!
