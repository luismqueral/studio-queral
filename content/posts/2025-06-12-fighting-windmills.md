One of my ongoing side-quests (I guess also battles?) has been what to do about my journal. Specifically what to do about my *Studio Log* which is the thing you're reading right now.

I've used Notion for close to 8 years now and dumped a *lot* of thoughts into that app. But it had it's limits, even if the conveniences kept me coming back for awhile. At least until recently!!

I've finally settled on a solution that I'm somewhat happy with and seems to be helping (evidenced by the amount through which I am actually writing).

At some point I'll try and capture my Obsidian setup in more detail, along with my thoughts on over-complicating systems, but this seems to really be working and sticking for me personally at least.

_Writing_ is one thing, _sharing_ is another, which I think is also handled well by a new system that I was able to cobble together with _Cursor_ and _Next.js_ â€” which resulted in an app / deployment process that preps all of this and sends it to Vercel. The biggest blocker there has always been storage, which was also figured out with "Blobs" (again something else I can get into another time).
