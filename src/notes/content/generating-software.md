## The value and pitfalls of "vibecoding" software projects as non-developer.

> **"Vibecoding"** in this instance refers to quick software POC's that may work (even in a production environment!) but whose internals aren't understood by the author because it was generated by an LLM. It might be tempting to discard this kind of software-making as invalid, but when used as scaffolding for proving real, working ideas without interrupting limited engineering capacity, vibecoded software POC's can be extraordinarily powerful.

## Criteria

A set of criteria to evaluate opportunities for these kinds of applications.

| Criteria | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Standalone** | Independent deployment, no shared dependencies. |
| **Single Purpose** | Does one, focused thing. |
| **Small Footprint** | A good rule of thumb is that the codebase architecture can be read and generally understood by an engineer in a few minutes. |
| **Lower Risk** | Failure won't impact core business or userbase, especially in a production environment. |
| **Low Maintenance** | Reliable enough that it won't require constant maintenance. |
| **Balanced Value** | Important enough to matter, safe enough to experiment. |
| **Few Dependencies** | 0-2 simple external systems max. Ideally no downstream dependencies. |
| **Simple Data** | Basic Create/Read/Update/Deploy, forms, or read-only displays |

It's worth noting that if a "vibecoded" project produces enough value and seeks scale (aka "Success!"), it will likely need to be refactored.

## Example Projects

Here are a few kinds of projects that may fit the criteria above.

- Interaction UX Vision / Prototypes
- Utility Scripts and Small Terminal-based Applications
- Static Sites / Landing Pages
  - Documentation Presentation
- One-Off Chrome Extensions
- Software Plug-ins
  - Adobe (AE Scripts, Illustrator plug-ins, etc.)
  - Obsidian
  - Figma

## Red Flags

Here are a few red flags that imply complexity beyond what can be easily managed:

- Accounts, Logging In
- API Usage
