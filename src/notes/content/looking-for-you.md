### Beefy Guy on the Brooklyn Bound F

Once upon a time, on a crowded train ride back from Manhattan, a handsome fella and a bearded man locked eyes. The bearded man, who was 45 years old and just a regular guy, noticed that the handsome fella was also stroking his chin. They shared a smile and the bearded man couldn't help but feel a spark of connection.

As the train rolled on, the two men continued to steal glances at each other, both feeling an undeniable attraction. The bearded man wanted to reach out and talk to the handsome fella, but he was too shy. He couldn't believe his luck when he saw the handsome fella post a missed connection on craigslist, asking him to reach out if the encounter sounded interesting.

Excited at the prospect of finally getting to know the handsome fella, the bearded man quickly responded to the ad. They made plans to meet for a drink and hit it off immediately. It turned out that they had a lot in common and the spark of attraction they had felt on the train quickly turned into a full-blown romance.

But as time went on, the bearded man began to realize that the handsome fella wasn't quite as perfect as he had originally thought. He was selfish and inconsiderate, often putting his own needs ahead of his partner's. Despite this, the bearded man tried to make their relationship work, hoping that the handsome fella would change.

Unfortunately, his efforts were in vain. The handsome fella continued to treat the bearded man poorly and their relationship became increasingly toxic. The bearded man eventually realized that he deserved better and made the difficult decision to end things.

Heartbroken and alone, the bearded man looked back on the missed connection that had brought him and the handsome fella together. He couldn't help but wonder if things would have turned out differently if he had never responded to the ad. It just goes to show that sometimes, even a seemingly perfect connection can end in misery.

### Latina Woman--Gets on Near 27th and Ditmars Q69 Bus Stop Every Morning (Astoria)

I've been watching you for weeks now, always from a distance. I see you at the bus stop, or walking down the street, or sitting in the park. You always seem so lost in thought, so beautiful and mysterious.

I've wanted to approach you and strike up a conversation, but I've always been too afraid. What if you weren't interested? What if I made a fool of myself? So I've kept my distance, telling myself that I would regret it if I didn't at least try.

But today, something changed. I was walking down the street, lost in thought, when I saw you standing at the bus stop. You were wearing a green coat and a pair of ripped jeans, and you had a backpack slung over your shoulder. I couldn't help but notice the way the sun caught your hair, making it shine like gold.

This time, I didn't hesitate. I marched over to the bus stop and stood next to you, my heart pounding in my chest. I could feel your eyes on me, and for a moment, I thought you were going to say something.

But then the bus arrived, and you boarded it without a word. I watched as it pulled away, taking you out of my life just as quickly as you had entered it.

Now, all I have is this missed connection and the memory of your sparkling eyes and your beautiful smile. I hope that somehow, some way, you will see this and know that I was there, that I wanted to talk to you.

If you're reading this, please take a chance and reach out to me. Maybe we can grab a coffee and get to know each other better. I don't want to keep watching you from afar anymore. I want to be with you, to share in your life and your thoughts. Please, give me this chance.

### Looking for sharpshooters to play darts with (Kips Bay)

Are you a skilled dart thrower looking for a competitive edge? Look no further! I am a seasoned dart player, with years of experience in both local and national tournaments. I am looking for dedicated and talented individuals to join my team and compete in various dart competitions.

As a member of my team, you will have the opportunity to hone your skills and improve your accuracy under my guidance. I will provide regular training sessions and offer expert advice on technique and strategy.

Qualified applicants should have experience playing darts and a strong desire to compete at a high level. A positive attitude and team player mentality are a must.

I come from a long line of dart players, and I have been playing since I was a child. My father was a professional dart player, and he pushed me to excel in the game from a young age. However, our relationship was always strained, and my father's demanding and critical nature often made me feel inadequate.

Despite our rocky relationship, I continued to pursue my passion for darts and worked hard to improve my skills. I joined local leagues and started competing in tournaments, eventually earning a spot on the national team.

But my success on the darting circuit only made my relationship with my father more difficult. He was envious of my accomplishments and resentful of my independence. We argued often, and our relationship became more and more strained.

Despite the challenges, I have continued to follow my passion for darts and have found success on the national stage. I have won several tournaments and have earned a reputation as a skilled and dedicated player.

If you are interested in joining my dart team and taking your game to the next level, please contact me to discuss further. Let's aim for victory together!

### Seeking Adonis at 5 O'clock Mass (Lambertville)

It was Christmas Eve and I was feeling a little lonely, you know how it is. I figured, what the heck, I'll go to the 5 o'clock mass and see if that makes me feel any better. So, I head over to the church and I'm sitting in the back, kind of trying to blend in with the crowd.

That's when I see him. He's a few rows in front of me, and he's got this amazing head of dark hair and he's wearing a blue sweater. And let me tell you, he is one good-looking dude. I mean, I'm not trying to be shallow or anything, but I just couldn't stop staring at him. He had this aura about him, like he was the coolest guy in the room. And I'm thinking to myself, 'I've got to find a way to talk to this guy.'

So, this sweater, right? I mean, talk about a showstopper. It's this deep, rich blue color, like the ocean on a clear summer day. And the fabric, oh man, it's like the softest, coziest thing you've ever touched. It's got a round neckline and long sleeves, and it fits him like a glove. I mean, seriously, he must work out or something because this sweater is showing off every muscle he's got. And the sleeves, they're a little bit longer than his wrists, which gives him this laid-back, casual vibe. But here's the thing: the sweater is a little bit wrinkled. Like, he's been wearing it all day and then just threw it on for the Christmas Eve mass.

But that's what I love about it, you know? It makes him seem like a regular guy, not someone who's trying too hard. Maybe he's got a high-stress job, you know? Like, he's a brain surgeon or something and he's always rushing around. So he throws on the first thing he sees in the morning and doesn't have time to iron it. I mean, let's face it, who has time to iron a sweater when you're saving lives all day? Or maybe he's got kids, right? And they're always pulling on his clothes and messing them up. I mean, have you ever tried to keep a sweater looking nice when you've got little ones running around? It's impossible. But hey, at least it shows he's a good dad, right?

Or maybe he's just a relaxed, laid-back guy, you know? Like, he doesn't care about wrinkles or anything like that. He's just happy to be alive and he doesn't sweat the small stuff. I mean, if that's the case, then I'm all for it. There's nothing sexier than a man who doesn't take himself too seriously.

So, if you're the guy I'm talking about, and you're reading this ad, drop me a line. Let's get together and talk. Maybe we can go grab a coffee or something.

### Skilled Laborer Seeking Opportunities (Baltimore)

Hey there! My brother is a single dad who is looking for a job to support his son. He's a hard worker and he's good at a lot of things. He's worked in customer service, retail, and home repair. He's done a lot of different jobs and he's always done them well.

One thing that makes my brother special is that he has really big knees. This can be helpful for some physical jobs because he can squat or kneel for a long time without getting tired. His big knees make it easier for him to do tasks like laying tiles, painting, or putting in flooring.

Unfortunately, my brother's big knees have caused some problems for him. Our mom has always had a hard time accepting him for who he is, and his knee size has been a point of contention for as long as I can remember. She's always made mean comments about it and it's really hurt his feelings. It's caused a lot of tension between them and they don't have the best relationship because of it.

It got worse after a fight over thanksgiving. My brother and our mom were sitting in the living room, talking about plans for the week. My brother had just gotten a new job and he wanted to tell our mom about it.

But as soon as he mentioned the job, our mom's attitude changed. She looked at him and said, "You know they're never gonna hire someone with knees like yours. You might as well just give up now."

My brother was heartbroken. He had worked really hard to get this job and he didn't understand why our mom couldn't be happy for him. He stood up and ran out of the room, crying.

For weeks, my brother didn't talk to our mom. He moved out of the house and into his own apartment, determined to make a life for himself and his son. It was a tough time for all of us, but my brother was determined to show our mom that he could be successful, even with big knees.

But my brother is strong and he's determined to make things work for his son. He's a good dad and he wants to provide for his family. If you need help with any physical jobs, my brother would be happy to help out. He's a good worker and he'll get the job done right. Thanks for considering him.

### Looking for my nerd gal shenanigans (Perry Hall)

Looking for my naughty nerd gal. We used to meet up for random shenanigans last year. Would love to do that again. Fun nerd guy here. I've actually picked up a new hobby recently - coin collecting. It's been so much fun learning about different coins from all around the world and adding to my collection. I'm especially interested in ancient coins and the stories they tell about civilizations long gone.

I love learning about the different cultures and histories represented by these coins, and it's amazing to hold something that is thousands of years old. One of my favorite coins is the ancient Greek coin called the tetradrachm, which was used in Athens around the 5th century BC. It features the head of the goddess Athena on one side and an owl on the other, and it was considered one of the most important coins of the ancient world. I've had a blast trying to find rare and unique coins too.

If you're the naughty nerd gal I used to know, or if you're a new naughty nerd gal who wants to play and possibly talk coins with me, hit me up!

### the truth about JOE BIDEN and the demoncrats (you won't believe this)

<div class="mv4">
  <img src="/notes/looking-for-you/chaos.png" class="w-70" />
</div>

As the forces of Chaos descended upon the mortal realm, the dark influence of Slaanesh could be felt everywhere. Under the guidance of Joe Biden, the deity's puppet, Operation Warp Speed became a tool of tyranny, mandating vaccinations and mask wearing upon the people and ignoring the protections of the Constitution.

Only the judicial branch stood as a bulwark against the darkness, fighting to defend the people and their children from the mandatory vaccines and masks. But even as Joe Biden opened the borders to caravans of unvaccinated illegal immigrants, he threatened to remove Title 42 and allow even more invaders to flood into the realm, spreading the influence of Slaanesh even further.

The realms of the world shook with fear as Slaanesh's influence spread like a plague, weakening America's power. Chaos sorcerers worked their dark magic, manipulating world events to serve the deity's goals. Russia invaded Ukraine, the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, North Korea launched ICBMs, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince threatened to align with Russia and China, and China prepared to invade Taiwan and expand its influence in the Pacific through a security pact with the Solomon Islands.

Inflation reached heights not seen in centuries, as Joe Biden and his Democratic allies passed trillions of dollars in spending packages, all at the direction of the chaos sorcerers and in the name of advancing Slaanesh's agenda. Fuel and energy prices skyrocketed as Joe Biden cancelled the Keystone pipeline and banned the import of Russian oil, furthering the goals of the chaos sorcerers and the deity they served.

The mortal realm teetered on the brink of destruction, as the forces of Chaos grew stronger with each passing day. Only the bravest and most stalwart defenders stood between the light and the darkness, fighting to turn back the tide of chaos and save the world from the clutches of Slaanesh and the malevolent sorcerers who served it.

As Joe Biden's decisions tore America apart and made the world a more dangerous place for its citizens, the forces of Chaos grew stronger with each passing day. The dark influence of Slaanesh could be felt everywhere, as the deity's puppets worked to advance its agenda and bring the mortal realm under its control. Only the bravest and most stalwart defenders stood between the light and the darkness, fighting to turn back the tide of chaos and save the world from the clutches of Slaanesh.
