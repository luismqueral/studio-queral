I've been collecting creative thinking prompts—strategies that help approach design challenges from unexpected angles. They're inspired by [Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies), the deck of cards created by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt in 1975.

The idea behind lateral thinking is simple: when you're stuck, a direct assault on the problem rarely works. Instead, you approach it sideways—through constraints, provocations, or deliberate disruptions that break your habitual patterns.

Eno and Schmidt's original cards offered cryptic prompts like *"Honor thy error as a hidden intention"* and *"What would your closest friend do?"* They were designed for musicians, but the principle applies anywhere creative work happens.

My collection expands on this concept with prompts drawn from psychology, history, science, philosophy, and art—each offering a different lens through which to view a problem.

## How to Use Them

Pick a strategy that feels relevant (or deliberately irrelevant) to your current challenge:

```
I'm working on [describe your project briefly]. 

Please apply the "Honor the Shadows" strategy to help me 
think about this differently.
```

Or try random selection for broader exploration:

```
Select 5 random strategies and apply each one to 
[describe your project]. Give me distinct perspectives 
on how to approach this challenge.
```

## Some Favorites

### Honor the Shadows
*Theme: Psychology*

> What exists in the shadows of this project, unacknowledged? Identify the overlooked aspects, the negative spaces, or the deliberately ignored elements. Sometimes the most profound insights are found not in the light, but in what we've chosen to leave in the dark.

### Follow the Resistance
*Theme: Philosophy*

> Where do you feel resistance, friction, or difficulty? Instead of overcoming these, follow them deliberately. What happens when you move *toward* what resists you?

### Break the Container
*Theme: Philosophy*

> What invisible containers—assumptions, frameworks, boundaries—currently hold this work? Identify them precisely. Then, deliberately shatter at least one. What spills out?

### Excavate the Palimpsest
*Theme: History*

> Approach this situation as a palimpsest—a manuscript with layers of text written, erased, and overwritten across time. What earlier inscriptions remain partially visible beneath current narratives?

### Apply Quantum Tunneling
*Theme: Science*

> Consider this through quantum tunneling: particles passing through impenetrable barriers. What supposedly insurmountable obstacles might be traversed by probability, not force?

### Invoke Dadaist Disruption
*Theme: Art*

> Apply Dadaist principles. What happens when you deliberately introduce chaos, absurdity, or anti-logic into the process?

## The Full Collection

The complete set includes strategies drawn from:

- **Psychology** — Shadow work, resistance, cognitive reframing
- **History** — Phoenician trading, Ottoman governance, Hanseatic cooperation
- **Science** — Quantum mechanics, systems thinking, emergence
- **Philosophy** — Stoicism, Zen, phenomenology
- **Art** — Dadaism, minimalism, found objects

The goal isn't to find "the answer"—it's to generate new angles, to see what you couldn't see before. Like Eno's original cards, they work best when you commit to following wherever the prompt leads, even when it feels irrelevant or uncomfortable.
