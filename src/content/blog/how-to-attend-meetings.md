If your calendar looks anything like this, you might have a problem:

The good news? **Attending a meeting is a choice.**

## How Not to Choose

When deciding whether to attend a meeting, don't base your decision on:

- **Urgency** — Just because something feels urgent doesn't mean it requires your presence
- **Importance** — Important topics can often be handled asynchronously
- **Seniority** — The person's title shouldn't automatically command your time
- **Calendar availability** — An open slot doesn't mean you should fill it

## How to Choose

Instead, use this simple decision framework:

![Meeting decision flowchart](/images/blog/how-to-attend-meetings/page-004.png)

1. **Can I contribute or gain a unique perspective at this meeting?**
   - If No → Decline
   - If Yes → Continue to step 2

2. **Does this perspective have value?**
   - If No → Decline
   - If Yes → Attend

## Meeting Agendas Are the Key

Agendas clarify the outcome of the meeting. If there is no clear outcome, contributions are unlikely to have value.

**Your attendance at a meeting deserves an agenda.**

### No agenda? Ask for one!

> "Could you please add an agenda to this meeting invite? I want to make sure I know how to prepare for this meeting so I can make the best use of your time."

### Responding Before Declining

Before declining, consider asking:

- "How should I prepare for this meeting?"
- "What are you looking to hear from me in this meeting?"

## Red Flags

Watch out for these warning signs:

- **Meetings over 30 minutes** — Most decisions can be made faster
- **Recurring meetings of any duration or frequency** — Question their necessity regularly
- **Meetings with no agenda that are not 1-on-1s** — These rarely produce value
- **Optional meetings** — If you're optional, you probably don't need to be there
- **Meetings with agendas that are not about making a decision, brainstorming, or rallying the troops** — What's the point?
- **Meetings with descriptions focused on discussion without clear outcomes** — Discussion alone isn't a goal

## Meeting Flavors

Meetings come in different flavors across three dimensions:

| Purpose | Size | Communication Style |
|---------|------|-------------------|
| Giving Feedback | 1-on-1s | Synchronous |
| Sharing | Leads | Asynchronous |
| Discussing | Small | Detailed |
| Updating | Medium | High-Level |
| Deciding | Large | Functional |
| Brainstorming | | Cross-Functional |
| Rallying the Troops | | |

### Good Meeting Flavor Combinations

Like chocolate and peanut butter, some combinations just work:

![Good meeting combinations](/images/blog/how-to-attend-meetings/page-010.png)

- **Large + Rallying the Troops** — All-hands, team celebrations
- **Small + Deciding + Leads + High-Level** — Executive decisions
- **Medium + Updating + Asynchronous** — Status updates (async!)
- **Small + Discussing + Functional + Detailed** — Working sessions
- **1-on-1 + Giving Feedback** — Performance conversations
- **Medium + Brainstorming + Cross-Functional** — Creative sessions

### Bad Meeting Flavor Combinations

Like marinara on vanilla cake, some combinations don't work:

![Bad meeting combinations](/images/blog/how-to-attend-meetings/page-011.png)

- **Small + Brainstorming** — Not enough perspectives
- **Large + Deciding** — Too many cooks
- **Large + Updating** — Could be an email
- **Anything but 1-on-1 + Giving Feedback** — Feedback should be private
- **Asynchronous + Rallying the Troops** — Energy doesn't translate
- **Large + Discussing** — Chaos

## Real Meeting Invite Examples

### Example 1: The Red Flag Meeting

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Title | Discuss Important Project |
| Duration | 45 minutes |
| Guests | 14 guests |
| Recurrence | None |
| Description | None |

**Analysis:** 45 minutes ÷ 14 guests = **3.2 minutes of speaking per guest**. Will you be speaking more or less than average? Will hearing other people speak be valuable to you? And where's the agenda?

### Example 2: The Recurring Update

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Title | Important Project that sometimes involves you |
| Duration | 30 minutes |
| Guests | 21 guests |
| Recurrence | Weekly |
| Description | Weekly check in to review Important Project execution. See plan for details |

**Analysis:** 30 minutes ÷ 21 guests = **1.43 minutes of speaking per guest**. Is this a standup? Will you have something important to share or learn in *each* meeting? Consider checking the plan each week and deciding to attend based on the contents and whether you will have something important to share and learn.

### Example 3: The Good Meeting

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Title | Decisions on Important Projects |
| Duration | 60 minutes |
| Guests | 8 guests |
| Recurrence | None |
| Description | Our team would like to decide whether to move forward with 2 Important Projects. 1:00pm-1:30pm: Project A (You are only needed for this part). 1:30pm-2:00pm: Project B (You are not needed for this part)... |

**Analysis:** Making decisions is a great reason to meet! 60 minutes ÷ 8 guests = **7.5 minutes of speaking per guest** — now we're talking! And with a detailed agenda, you can also choose to attend only the relevant half of this meeting.

## What Else Can I Do to Protect My Time?

![Calendar with lunch blocked](/images/blog/how-to-attend-meetings/page-019.png)

**Schedule recurring time for things you know you need to do:**

- **Lunch** — cause you gotta eat
- **Prep time** before presentations or meetings you're hosting
- **Focus time** for deep work
- **Buffer time** between meetings

---

*Remember: Your time is valuable. Every meeting you attend is time you're not spending on deep work, creative thinking, or simply recovering your energy. Choose wisely.*
