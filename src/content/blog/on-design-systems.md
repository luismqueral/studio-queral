A design system isn't a component library. It's a shared language.

## The Problem

Every team I've worked with has faced the same challenge: as products grow, inconsistency creeps in. Not because anyone is careless, but because context is lost. The button that was blue in 2021 becomes teal in 2023 because someone didn't know the original decision existed.

## What Actually Works

The best design systems I've seen share a few traits:

1. **They document the *why*, not just the *what*.** A color isn't just `#357edd`. It's "our primary action color, chosen for accessibility against white backgrounds."

2. **They're discoverable.** If a designer has to ask where something is, the system has failed.

3. **They evolve.** A system that can't change becomes a cage.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

You don't need a design system until you do. And by the time you realize you need one, you're already dealing with the debt.

Start small. Document decisions as you make them. The system will emerge.
