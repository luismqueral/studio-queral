People ask about my setup. Here's what's actually on my dock.

## For Writing

**Obsidian** for notes and thinking. I've tried Notion, Roam, Logseq, and a dozen others. Obsidian wins because:
- Local markdown files I actually own
- Fast enough that I don't notice it
- Plugins when I need them, invisible when I don't

**iA Writer** for long-form. When I need to focus on just the words.

## For Design

**Figma** obviously. But increasingly, I sketch in code first. The feedback loop is faster.

## For Code

**Cursor** has replaced VS Code for me. The AI assistance isn't magic, but it removes enough friction that I think differently about what's worth building.

**Warp** for terminal. The AI features are fine, but the real win is that it just feels modern.

## What I've Stopped Using

- Slack (async is better)
- Most task managers (a text file works)
- Read-later apps (I was just hoarding)

The best tool is the one you'll actually use.
