<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants to run the project. Let me check the project structure and package.json to understand what kind of project this is and how to run it.

From the project layout, I can see:
- It's a Vite project (vite.config.js)
- It has a React app (App.jsx, main.jsx)
- It has an index.html and package.json

I should first check the package.json to see what scripts are available for running the project, then execute the appropriate command to start the development server.</details></think>

---

I'll check the package.json to see what scripts are available and then run the project for you.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
Perfect! The package.json shows this is a Vite React project. The development script is `npm run dev` or just `vite`. I'll run the dev command to start the development server. Since this is a development server that will run indefinitely, I should set `is_background` to true.</details></think>

The server is starting. Let me wait a moment and check if it's running properly by checking the output or trying to see if there are any errors.</details></think>

---

The development server is starting up! It should be running on the default Vite port (typically `http://localhost:5173`). The server is running in the background, so you can open your browser and navigate to that URL to view your project.

If you need to stop the server later, just let me know!

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants me to create or update a "project-rules" ruleset in Cursor that establishes the philosophical foundation for this static site, specifically noting that the project uses Tachyons for styling (not Tailwind).

Cursor rules are typically stored in a `.cursorrules` file in the project root. I should create this file with comprehensive guidelines about the project's philosophy and technical approach.

Let me create a well-structured `.cursorrules` file that covers:
1. The project's philosophy (static site, simplicity, performance)
2. Styling approach (Tachyons, not Tailwind)
3. React patterns and best practices for this project
4. File organization
5. Any other relevant architectural decisions

I should read the existing files first to understand the current state better.</details></think>

Good, now I have context. The project uses Tachyons (not Tailwind) and has custom Tachyons extensions. I can see the styling approach from the HomePage component - using Tachyons utility classes like `f4`, `lh-copy`, `mw5-5`, `center`, etc.

+ # Studio Queral 2026 - Project Rules
+ 
+ ## Project Philosophy
+ 
+ This is a **personal portfolio site** built with simplicity, performance, and creative expression as core values. The site prioritizes:
+ 
+ - **Minimalism with personality** - Clean design with moments of delight (WebGL morphing, random takes)
+ - **Performance first** - Static site generation, minimal JavaScript, fast load times
+ - **Readable, maintainable code** - Clear patterns, functional React, no unnecessary abstractions
+ - **Creative experimentation** - Space for playful features (WebGL art, random thoughts, newsletter)
+ 
+ ## Technology Stack
+ 
+ ### Core Framework
+ - **React 18** with Vite for development
+ - Functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
+ - No routing library needed - single page application with sections
+ - No state management library - simple component-level state
+ 
+ ### Styling Architecture
+ 
+ **CRITICAL: This project uses TACHYONS, NOT Tailwind CSS**
+ 
+ #### Tachyons Approach
+ - **Utility-first CSS framework** - compose designs with single-purpose classes
+ - **Custom extensions** in &#96;src/styles/tachyons-ext.css&#96; for project-specific needs
+ - **Base font size**: 18px (larger than default for better readability)
+ - **Scale**: Typography uses Tachyons scale (f1-f7), spacing uses Tachyons spacing (pa1-7, ma1-7)
+ 
+ #### Common Tachyons Classes Used in This Project
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ Typography: f4 (primary body), f5 (secondary), lh-copy (line height)
+ Spacing: pa3 (padding), ma3 (margin), mb3 (margin-bottom), pt4 (padding-top)
+ Layout: center (horizontal center), mw5-5 (custom max-width 30rem)
+ Colors: near-black, blue, hover-dark-blue, bg-white-gray-gradient
+ Utilities: link (reset link styles), hover-underline
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ #### Custom Tachyons Extensions (tachyons-ext.css)
+ - &#96;.mw5-5&#96; - max-width: 30rem (custom container size for homepage)
+ - &#96;.font-*&#96; classes - custom font family utilities
+ - &#96;.tag-pill&#96; - styled tag/category pills with hover effects
+ - &#96;.inline-code&#96; - inline code styling
+ - Code block styling (pre, code elements)
+ - Scrollbar gutter management
+ 
+ #### When Adding Styles
+ 1. **Check Tachyons first** - most needs are covered by core classes
+ 2. **Use tachyons-ext.css** for project-specific utilities
+ 3. **Avoid inline styles** except for dynamic/JS-driven values (e.g., whiteSpace in JSX)
+ 4. **Never use Tailwind syntax** (e.g., &#96;bg-gray-100&#96;, &#96;text-lg&#96;, &#96;hover:bg-blue-500&#96;)
+ 5. **Follow Tachyons naming** - abbreviated, single-purpose class names
+ 
+ ### File Structure
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ src/
+   components/      # React components (HomePage, WebGLMorpher, FeaturedSection, etc.)
+   styles/          # CSS files (tachyons-ext.css, custom.css)
+   main.jsx         # Entry point
+   App.jsx          # Root component
+ public/
+   images/          # Static images (luis.png, pelican.png, projects/)
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ## React Patterns
+ 
+ ### Component Guidelines
+ - **Functional components only** - no class components
+ - **Hooks for state** - useState, useEffect, useRef as needed
+ - **Props destructuring** - clear component APIs
+ - **Minimal prop drilling** - keep component tree flat when possible
+ - **Comments for non-obvious logic** - especially WebGL, animations, random takes
+ 
+ ### WebGL Patterns (WebGLMorpher.jsx)
+ - Use refs for WebGL context, canvas, animation frames
+ - Proper cleanup in useEffect returns (stop animation loops, dispose resources)
+ - Avoid stale closures - use refs for values read in animation loops
+ - Initialize textures async with loading states
+ 
+ ### State Management
+ - **Component-level state** for UI interactions (slider values, loading states)
+ - **useEffect for side effects** (loading random takes, initializing WebGL)
+ - **No global state** - props for component communication
+ 
+ ## Content Patterns
+ 
+ ### Random Takes Feature
+ - Array of opinionated statements in HomePage.jsx
+ - Selected randomly on mount with useEffect
+ - Currently commented out but infrastructure in place
+ - Add more takes to the &#96;takes&#96; array as desired
+ 
+ ### Newsletter Integration
+ - Uses Buttondown email service
+ - Simple form embed (not API integration)
+ - Form action points to studioqueral Buttondown newsletter
+ 
+ ### Featured/Recent Work Section
+ - Currently commented out while gathering project content
+ - FeaturedSection.jsx ready to display projects with images
+ - Project layout: year labels in left margin, titles flush with heading, images below
+ 
+ ## Development Workflow
+ 
+ ### Running the Project
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ npm install          # Install dependencies
+ npm run dev          # Start dev server (Vite)
+ npm run build        # Production build
+ npm run preview      # Preview production build
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Making Changes
+ 1. Edit components in src/components/
+ 2. Style with Tachyons classes (check tachyons-ext.css for custom utilities)
+ 3. Test in browser at localhost:5173
+ 4. Commit with descriptive messages
+ 5. Update CHANGELOG.md (automated via user rules)
+ 
+ ### Deployment
+ - GitHub repository: github.com/luismqueral/studio-queral
+ - Deployed via Vercel
+ - vercel.json configured for Vite static site
+ 
+ ## Code Quality Standards
+ 
+ ### What to Prioritize
+ - **Readability** - clear variable names, logical organization
+ - **Simplicity** - avoid over-engineering, prefer straightforward solutions
+ - **Performance** - minimize re-renders, optimize WebGL, lazy load when beneficial
+ - **Consistency** - follow existing patterns in the codebase
+ 
+ ### What to Avoid
+ - Over-abstraction (unnecessary custom hooks, contexts)
+ - Premature optimization
+ - Mixing styling approaches (stick with Tachyons)
+ - Large dependencies (evaluate bundle size impact)
+ - Breaking changes without strong justification
+ 
+ ## AI Assistant Guidance
+ 
+ When working on this project:
+ 
+ 1. **Always use Tachyons classes**, never Tailwind syntax
+ 2. **Check existing components** for patterns before creating new approaches
+ 3. **Maintain the minimal aesthetic** - add features thoughtfully
+ 4. **Keep bundle size small** - avoid heavy dependencies
+ 5. **Test interactive features** - especially WebGL, animations, forms
+ 6. **Update CHANGELOG.md** after significant changes (per user rules)
+ 7. **Preserve creative features** - random takes, WebGL morphing, newsletter
+ 
+ ## Future Considerations
+ 
+ Planned but not yet implemented:
+ - Projects/recent work section (FeaturedSection ready)
+ - Writing/blog section
+ - About page with more biographical info
+ - More random takes
+ 
+ Keep these in mind when making architectural decisions.

Excellent! I've created a comprehensive `.cursorrules` file that will guide all future development on this project. This file will be automatically picked up by Cursor and inform AI assistants working on your codebase.

## Key Benefits:

✅ **Prevents Tailwind confusion** - Explicitly states "This project uses TACHYONS, NOT Tailwind CSS" with clear examples and warnings

✅ **Documents your philosophy** - Captures the minimalist-with-personality approach, performance-first mindset, and creative experimentation space

✅ **Styling guidelines** - Lists common Tachyons classes you use, documents custom extensions in `tachyons-ext.css`, and provides clear rules for when to add styles

✅ **React patterns** - Establishes functional component conventions, hooks usage, and WebGL-specific patterns

✅ **AI assistant guidance** - Specific instructions for AI helpers to always use Tachyons, check existing patterns, maintain the minimal aesthetic, and update the changelog

✅ **Future-proofing** - Documents planned features (projects section, writing, about page) so architectural decisions consider them

The file is now active and will guide any AI assistance or future development. Would you like me to commit this new `.cursorrules` file to the repository?

@.cursorrules this shuold be project-rules.mdc inside of cursor/rules

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-sonnet-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants me to move the `.cursorrules` file to `.cursor/rules/project-rules.mdc` instead. Let me:
1. Create the directory structure if needed
2. Move the content to the new location
3. Delete the old `.cursorrules` file
4. Update the CHANGELOG</details></think>

I'll move the content to `.cursor/rules/project-rules.mdc` and remove the `.cursorrules` file:

+ # Studio Queral 2026 - Project Rules
+ 
+ ## Project Philosophy
+ 
+ This is a **personal portfolio site** built with simplicity, performance, and creative expression as core values. The site prioritizes:
+ 
+ - **Minimalism with personality** - Clean design with moments of delight (WebGL morphing, random takes)
+ - **Performance first** - Static site generation, minimal JavaScript, fast load times
+ - **Readable, maintainable code** - Clear patterns, functional React, no unnecessary abstractions
+ - **Creative experimentation** - Space for playful features (WebGL art, random thoughts, newsletter)
+ 
+ ## Technology Stack
+ 
+ ### Core Framework
+ - **React 18** with Vite for development
+ - Functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
+ - No routing library needed - single page application with sections
+ - No state management library - simple component-level state
+ 
+ ### Styling Architecture
+ 
+ **CRITICAL: This project uses TACHYONS, NOT Tailwind CSS**
+ 
+ #### Tachyons Approach
+ - **Utility-first CSS framework** - compose designs with single-purpose classes
+ - **Custom extensions** in &#96;src/styles/tachyons-ext.css&#96; for project-specific needs
+ - **Base font size**: 18px (larger than default for better readability)
+ - **Scale**: Typography uses Tachyons scale (f1-f7), spacing uses Tachyons spacing (pa1-7, ma1-7)
+ 
+ #### Common Tachyons Classes Used in This Project
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ Typography: f4 (primary body), f5 (secondary), lh-copy (line height)
+ Spacing: pa3 (padding), ma3 (margin), mb3 (margin-bottom), pt4 (padding-top)
+ Layout: center (horizontal center), mw5-5 (custom max-width 30rem)
+ Colors: near-black, blue, hover-dark-blue, bg-white-gray-gradient
+ Utilities: link (reset link styles), hover-underline
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ #### Custom Tachyons Extensions (tachyons-ext.css)
+ - &#96;.mw5-5&#96; - max-width: 30rem (custom container size for homepage)
+ - &#96;.font-*&#96; classes - custom font family utilities
+ - &#96;.tag-pill&#96; - styled tag/category pills with hover effects
+ - &#96;.inline-code&#96; - inline code styling
+ - Code block styling (pre, code elements)
+ - Scrollbar gutter management
+ 
+ #### When Adding Styles
+ 1. **Check Tachyons first** - most needs are covered by core classes
+ 2. **Use tachyons-ext.css** for project-specific utilities
+ 3. **Avoid inline styles** except for dynamic/JS-driven values (e.g., whiteSpace in JSX)
+ 4. **Never use Tailwind syntax** (e.g., &#96;bg-gray-100&#96;, &#96;text-lg&#96;, &#96;hover:bg-blue-500&#96;)
+ 5. **Follow Tachyons naming** - abbreviated, single-purpose class names
+ 
+ ### File Structure
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ src/
+   components/      # React components (HomePage, WebGLMorpher, FeaturedSection, etc.)
+   styles/          # CSS files (tachyons-ext.css, custom.css)
+   main.jsx         # Entry point
+   App.jsx          # Root component
+ public/
+   images/          # Static images (luis.png, pelican.png, projects/)
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ## React Patterns
+ 
+ ### Component Guidelines
+ - **Functional components only** - no class components
+ - **Hooks for state** - useState, useEffect, useRef as needed
+ - **Props destructuring** - clear component APIs
+ - **Minimal prop drilling** - keep component tree flat when possible
+ - **Comments for non-obvious logic** - especially WebGL, animations, random takes
+ 
+ ### WebGL Patterns (WebGLMorpher.jsx)
+ - Use refs for WebGL context, canvas, animation frames
+ - Proper cleanup in useEffect returns (stop animation loops, dispose resources)
+ - Avoid stale closures - use refs for values read in animation loops
+ - Initialize textures async with loading states
+ 
+ ### State Management
+ - **Component-level state** for UI interactions (slider values, loading states)
+ - **useEffect for side effects** (loading random takes, initializing WebGL)
+ - **No global state** - props for component communication
+ 
+ ## Content Patterns
+ 
+ ### Random Takes Feature
+ - Array of opinionated statements in HomePage.jsx
+ - Selected randomly on mount with useEffect
+ - Currently commented out but infrastructure in place
+ - Add more takes to the &#96;takes&#96; array as desired
+ 
+ ### Newsletter Integration
+ - Uses Buttondown email service
+ - Simple form embed (not API integration)
+ - Form action points to studioqueral Buttondown newsletter
+ 
+ ### Featured/Recent Work Section
+ - Currently commented out while gathering project content
+ - FeaturedSection.jsx ready to display projects with images
+ - Project layout: year labels in left margin, titles flush with heading, images below
+ 
+ ## Development Workflow
+ 
+ ### Running the Project
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;bash
+ npm install          # Install dependencies
+ npm run dev          # Start dev server (Vite)
+ npm run build        # Production build
+ npm run preview      # Preview production build
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Making Changes
+ 1. Edit components in src/components/
+ 2. Style with Tachyons classes (check tachyons-ext.css for custom utilities)
+ 3. Test in browser at localhost:5173
+ 4. Commit with descriptive messages
+ 5. Update CHANGELOG.md (automated via user rules)
+ 
+ ### Deployment
+ - GitHub repository: github.com/luismqueral/studio-queral
+ - Deployed via Vercel
+ - vercel.json configured for Vite static site
+ 
+ ## Code Quality Standards
+ 
+ ### What to Prioritize
+ - **Readability** - clear variable names, logical organization
+ - **Simplicity** - avoid over-engineering, prefer straightforward solutions
+ - **Performance** - minimize re-renders, optimize WebGL, lazy load when beneficial
+ - **Consistency** - follow existing patterns in the codebase
+ 
+ ### What to Avoid
+ - Over-abstraction (unnecessary custom hooks, contexts)
+ - Premature optimization
+ - Mixing styling approaches (stick with Tachyons)
+ - Large dependencies (evaluate bundle size impact)
+ - Breaking changes without strong justification
+ 
+ ## AI Assistant Guidance
+ 
+ When working on this project:
+ 
+ 1. **Always use Tachyons classes**, never Tailwind syntax
+ 2. **Check existing components** for patterns before creating new approaches
+ 3. **Maintain the minimal aesthetic** - add features thoughtfully
+ 4. **Keep bundle size small** - avoid heavy dependencies
+ 5. **Test interactive features** - especially WebGL, animations, forms
+ 6. **Update CHANGELOG.md** after significant changes (per user rules)
+ 7. **Preserve creative features** - random takes, WebGL morphing, newsletter
+ 
+ ## Future Considerations
+ 
+ Planned but not yet implemented:
+ - Projects/recent work section (FeaturedSection ready)
+ - Writing/blog section
+ - About page with more biographical info
+ - More random takes
+ 
+ Keep these in mind when making architectural decisions.

Wait, I see from the earlier file list that there's already a `.general-rules` file in the `.cursor/rules/` directory. Let me check if that needs to be updated or if it's separate. Actually, looking at the user's message again, they just wanted the project rules to be in the correct location, which I've done. The file is now at `.cursor/rules/project-rules.mdc` as requested.</details></think>

---

Perfect! I've successfully moved the project rules to the correct location:

✅ **Created**: `.cursor/rules/project-rules.mdc` with all the comprehensive project guidelines
✅ **Removed**: Old `.cursorrules` file 
✅ **Updated**: CHANGELOG.md to reflect the correct location

The file is now properly placed in Cursor's rules directory structure and will be recognized by the editor. The `.mdc` extension (Markdown Cursor) is the correct format for Cursor rules files.

Your project rules are now active and will guide AI assistance with emphasis on:
- Using **Tachyons** (not Tailwind) for all styling
- Following the minimalist-with-personality philosophy
- Maintaining React patterns with functional components and hooks
- Keeping the bundle small and performance-first

📝 **Changelog updated** - Documented creation of project rules at .cursor/rules/project-rules.mdc

The user wants to rename `custom.css` to `webgl-homepage-component.css` and update any files that reference it. Let me first find where this file is being imported.

I'll need to:
1. Search for references to `custom.css` in the codebase
2. Create the new file with the same content
3. Update the imports
4. Delete the old file</details></think>

I'll rename the file and update all references to it. Let me first find where it's being imported:

<tool-use data-tool-type="search" data-tool-name="grep">

Perfect! I've successfully renamed the file and updated all references:

**Changes made:**
- ✅ Created `src/styles/webgl-homepage-component.css` with all the original content
- ✅ Updated import in `src/main.jsx` to reference the new filename
- ✅ Deleted old `src/styles/custom.css` file

The new filename better describes the purpose of the file - containing styles specifically for the WebGL component on the homepage. All functionality remains the same, just with a more descriptive name.
